# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with Flutter and hosted on Firebase Hosting! This project showcases my journey in UI design, keeping the interface simple, straightforward, and a bit unique, as I've tried to make it with my current knowledge of design.

## Features
- **Built with Flutter**: Fully created with Flutter to provide a smooth, responsive experience across web and mobile platforms.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Deployed on Firebase Hosting for reliability and performance.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Simple, user-friendly UI with a unique twist in styling.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zimmer550i/portfolio_flutter.git
   cd portfolio_flutter
   ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration**:
   - This project is set up to optionally use Firebase Analytics.
   - If you'd like to enable Firebase features, add your `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files, and ensure Firebase Analytics is initialized in `main.dart`.
   - To proceed without Firebase Analytics, simply comment out the Firebase initialization lines in `main.dart`.

4. **Run the app locally**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Deployment
To deploy your version of the app to Firebase Hosting:
1. Make sure Firebase CLI is installed.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

## Acknowledgments
This project represents a small yet significant step in my journey as a developer and designer. I've focused on creating a clean, simple layout thatâ€™s easy to navigate.
